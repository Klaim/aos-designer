		@par
		Each project can contain:
		 - a set of sequences informations, which are associated with that project;
		 - a set of libraries which can be accessed by all the sequences in the project;
		 - a set of Editor instances, which are used to view and edit Sequence instances;
		@par
		Adding a sequence in the Project don't instantiate a Sequence object, 
		but opening an Editor of a sequence does (it needs to load the state of 
		the Sequence in memory and modify it accordingly).

		@remark The public member functions are all thread-safe.
		They return futures when the action will be done later 
		(usually on update, which is managed by the associated Workspace,
		@see WorkspaceObject ).
		They return by value or void when the action will be performed
		synchronously, which might imply waiting.
