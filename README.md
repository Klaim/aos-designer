AOSD uses AOSL to define digital stories, to allow any kind of sequence to be created.
It also works with exporters which will generate other formats for different interpreters.

### Dependencies

Both back-end and front-end implementations are using:

 * [Boost](http://boost.org): to complete the standard C++ library;
 * [AOSLCPP](https://github.com/artofsequence/aosl-cpp): library to read, write and interpret AOSL data;
 * [UtilCPP](https://github.com/artofsequence/utilcpp): some useful C++ tools;
 * [Google Test](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/): unit tests;
 

The back-end also relies on:

 * [Intel TBB](http://threadingbuildingblocks.org): concurrent containers and other concurrency tools;

The default front-end relies on Qt:

 * [Qt5](http://qt-project.org): used for GUI implementation;
